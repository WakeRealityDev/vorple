<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Introduction to Vorple</h3>

<h4>The short version</h4>

<p>
Vorple is a library and a custom web interpreter for 
<a href="http://inform7.com">Inform 7</a> that lets you do things that so 
far haven't been possible, like displaying images, playing sounds, 
adding tooltips and notifications and much more.
Take a look at the <a href="http://vorple-if.com/demo/#inform7">demo page</a> for 
some examples. 
</p>

<h4>The long version</h4>

<p>
Back in the days when home computers first entered consumer markets there were
many competing companies selling computers that weren't compatible with each other.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom">Infocom</a> had to solve the
problem of programming and distributing their games to as wide array of 
computers as possible (to maximize their potential customers) with varying
specifications and limitations.  
</p>

<p>
The solution was to create a virtual machine that would harmonize the 
differences between computer systems. The game file would always be
the same for each system and there would be an interpreter program that would
translate the game file into instructions the computer understood. This way
the game could be programmed and compiled only once and it would work on
any system that had an interpreter.
</p>

<img src="media/virtual-machine.png" alt="Virtual machine inside operating system">
	
<p>
The virtual machine was called <em>Z-machine</em> after Zork, the first game
that used it. Decades later Inform 7 still compiles to Z-machine (and Glulx, 
the contemporary virtual machine that works basically the same way). 
</p>

<p>
To a modern consumer of interactive fiction the virtual machine model has 
other benefits in addition to being able to play the stories in a wide selection
of devices. The virtual machine is effectively a <em>sandbox</em> that limits
what story files are allowed to do. They can't, for example, delete
files from the computer or install malicious software. When you download
an interactive fiction story file you can be certain that it isn't a virus
and it can't do anything harmful.
</p>

<p>
To an author of interactive fiction the sandbox can sometimes feel rather 
limiting. We've come a long way since the early days of Infocom and the 
things we now casually do with computers is far more than anyone could have dreamed
of 30 years ago. Yet interactive fiction is still confined to streaming text,
displaying pictures, playing sounds and performing some limited file operations.
</p>

<p>
Cue the Internet age. Parchment is an online Z-machine/Glulx interpreter
that lets you play interactive fiction on any computer with Internet access 
and a web browser. A modern web browser is also a sandbox, but with quite
a lot of more capabilities (but still restrictions in place so that in theory
you can visit any web page and be sure that you can't catch anything malicious).
</p>

<img src="media/parchment.png" alt="Virtual machine inside web browser inside operating system">

<p>
Parchment was a small revolution by itself and turned the community focus
from downloadable story files to Internet play, but Parchment is still "only"
an implementation of existing virtual machines. It restricts the story files
to the same sandbox as offline interpreters do. 
</p>

<p>
This is where Vorple comes in. It makes a small addition to the interpreter
so that the story files can break free of the Z-machine sandbox and communicate
with the browser running the interpreter.
</p>

<img src="media/vorple-bridge.png" alt="Vorple creating a bridge between the virtual machine and the browser">

<p>
With this bridge in place the story file can do pretty much whatever it wants
with the user interface and the story text&mdash;even story text that has
already been printed.
</p>

<p>
In addition Vorple provides a JavaScript library that makes it easier to
add features specifically to interactive fiction stories (as opposed to
usual web pages). The Inform 7 extensions are mainly interfaces to the
underlying JavaScript library. 
</p>

<p>
To recap, Vorple consists of three main features:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>JavaScript library for building and handling user interface elements</li>
	<li>Inform 7 extensions that can use the library</li>
	<li>Customized interpreter that lets the extensions access the library</li>
</ul>

<p>
The project's headquarters are at 
<a href="http://vorple-if.com">www.vorple-if.com</a> where you'll find all
the official materials and downloads. JavaScript developers who want to dig
into the innards of the system can find the source code at
<a href="http://github.com/juhana/vorple">Github</a>.
</p>

<p>
The library and all official materials are open source and free for anyone
to use for any purpose. (Mandatory footnote: Do still read all the licenses
if you want to use it commercially or as a part of a closed system. 
Some third party themes, for example, 
are subject to slightly more restrictive licenses.) 
</p>

<p>
Vorple is available also for <a href="http://undum.com">Undum</a>,
a hypertext fiction framework. It is described in detail in
<em><a href="../undum/enhancing-with-vorple.html">Enhancing Undum Hypertext 
Fiction with Vorple</a></em>.
</p>


<h3>Known limitations</h3>

<p>
Vorple is experimental software and in early stages of development.
There are a number of known issues that will be fixed in later releases:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Command history (browsing old commands with the up arrow key) isn't available.</li>
<li>Undoing is not reliable if the browser communicates with the story
	file using hidden commands.</li>
<li>Saving and restoring stories is likely to work erratically.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At the moment <strong>only Z-machine is supported</strong>. Glulx support is
waiting for the next version of the Glulx specification. 
This is to avoid creating a competing non-standard specification.
</p>


<h2>Installation and usage</h2>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Remember that the interpreter running inside the Inform IDE is not a 
Vorple-capable interpreter, so you won't see any of the new features 
when you run the story in it. You need to release the story and play
in a web browser instead. 
</p>


<h2>Support</h2>

<p>
The best place to look for assistance is the community forum at
<a href="http://intfiction.org/forum">intfiction.org</a>. Vorple's author
frequents the forum, as do other experienced authors who are happy to 
answer civilized help requests about authoring with Inform, Vorple or other
systems.

<a href="https://github.com/juhana/vorple/issues">Github pages</a> or by
