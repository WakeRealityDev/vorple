<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Introduction to Vorple</h3>

<p>
<em>Vorple</em> is a user interface library for interactive literature. 
Its goal is to let online hypertext fiction and parser interactive fiction systems
break out of their sandboxes and let story authors use the full scale of the vast 
possibilities of technologies that are commonly used in the World Wide Web.
</p>

<p>
Most interactive fiction development systems produce story files that are
played with a specialized interpreter. The interpreter model guarantees
high portability and security, but comes with the cost of binding the stories
inside the boundaries of the virtual machine. It has been very difficult if
not impossible for an author to accomplish something that the development
system has not provided. 
</p>

<p>
Vorple changes the game by letting the story file communicate with the
web interpreter. An author might use Vorple just to theme their story with one 
of the provided custom themes, or make a multimedia spectacle with pictures, 
video, sound effects and interactive elements, or anything in between or beyond.
</p>

<p>
Vorple comes with a custom 
<a href="https://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment">Parchment</a>
web interpreter that can communicate with the story file,
a number of <a href="http://inform7.com">Inform 7</a> extensions that 
provide the new features, and some custom themes. 
</p>

<p>
The project's headquarters are at 
<a href="http://vorple-if.com">www.vorple-if.com</a> where you'll find all
the official material and downloads. JavaScript developers who want to dig
into the innards of the system can find the source code at
<a href="http://github.com/juhana/vorple">Github</a>.
</p>

<p>
The library and all official material are open source and free for anyone
to use for any purpose. (Mandatory footnote: Do still read all the licenses
if you want to use it commercially or as a part of a closed system. 
Some third party themes, for example, 
are subject to slightly more restrictive licenses.) 
</p>


<h3>Known limitations</h3>

<p>
Vorple is experimental software and in early stages of development.
There are a number of known issues that will be fixed in later releases:

<ul>
<li>Single-character input is not supported, most notably pausing the
	story ("press any key to continue") does not work.</li>
<li>Status line isn't available, including features that are built on
	the status line like in-game menus.</li>
<li>Command history (browsing old commands with the up arrow key) isn't available.</li>
<li>Undoing is not reliable if the browser communicates with the story
	file using hidden commands.</li>
<li>Doesn't work with Internet Explorer 8. Not tested with earlier
	version of Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Sound does not work in all browsers.</li>
</ul>

At the moment <strong>only Z-machine is supported</strong>. Glulx support is
waiting for the next version of the Glulx specification. 
This is to avoid creating a competing non-standard specification.
</p>

<p>
There's a larger library running below the Inform layer and there isn't
yet extension coverage for all of it. If you're feeling adventurous you can
try to invoke the methods manually (with no guarantees of it working, 
of course). They are described in the <a href="../API">API</a> and in the 
<a href="../undum/enhancing-with-vorple.html">Undum sister manual</a>. 
</p>


<h2>Installation and usage</h2>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>
First of all, you need the <a href="http://inform7.com">Inform 7</a>
authoring system installed and the skills to use it. Inform comes with
comprehensive documentation, and other learning resources are listed
<a href="http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3988">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once you're ready with Inform, continue with Vorple:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Download the zip file that includes the interpreter template
	and the Inform 7 extensions. The extensions can also be downloaded
	individually, but they won't do anything without the interpreter.</li>
<li>Install the interpreter template by copying the <code>Vorple</code>
	directory to the <code>Templates</code> directory either in the 
	Inform's library directory or in an individual project's Materials
	directory, as per 
	<a href="http://inform7.com/learn/man/doc394.html">chapter 23.11</a> 
	in Writing with Inform.</li>
<li>Install the extensions (File&rarr;Install extension... in the Inform IDE menu).
	You must have at least the Vorple Core extension installed.</li>
<li>Read the extension documentation (Installed Extensions link in the
	IDE documentation page). Read at least the two first chapters of the
	Vorple Core extension's documentation.</li>
<li>Add a <code>Release along with the "Vorple" interpreter</code> line to
	the story source.</li>
<li>Click the "Release" button, then "browse play-in-browser page" link
	in the release report page.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Remember that the interpreter running inside the Inform IDE is not a 
Vorple-capable interpreter, so you won't see any of the new features 
when you run the story in it. You need to release the story and play
in a web browser instead. 
</p>


<h3>Custom CSS and JavaScript</h3>

<p>
The interpreter tries to load a <code>vorple.custom.css</code> CSS file
and a <code>vorple.custom.js</code> JavaScript file if they exist.
Those are the best places to put custom CSS and JavaScript code.
</p>

Place the file(s) in the Materials folder of the Inform project and
include them in the release:

<pre>
Release along with a file of "Custom CSS" called "vorple.custom.css".
Release along with a file of "Custom JavaScript" called "vorple.custom.js".
</pre>


<h2>Complete examples</h2>

<p>
A small preview includes many of the features.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../stories/inform7/preview Materials/Release/play.html">Play the preview</a></li>
<li><a href="../../stories/inform7/preview Materials/Release/source.txt">View the source code</a></li>
</ul>
</p>



<h2>Support</h2>

<p>
The best place to look for assistance is the community forum at
<a href="http://intfiction.org/forum">intfiction.org</a>. Vorple's author
frequents the forum, as do other experienced authors who are happy to 
answer civilized help requests about authoring with Inform, Vorple or other
systems.

<a href="https://github.com/juhana/vorple/issues">Github pages</a> or by
