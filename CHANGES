Release 2.5 (2013-??-??)
========================

I7 Extensions
-------------

 - Updated to work with the new I7 release
 - Changed the author's name from "The Vorple Project" to "Juhana Leinonen"
   to conform with Inform 7 extension guidelines, added "Vorple" in front
   of extension names, renamed "Core" to "Basics" and "Hypertext" to 
   "Hyperlinks"
 - Added the "Vorple Screen Effects" extension
 - Added and fixed examples across the board
 - Basics: Separate checks for new Z-machine 1.2 streams
   and caching Vorple availability (closes #1) 
 - Basics: Removed the Undo Output Control which is now unneeded
 - Basics: Reworked the creation and placing content to HTML tags completely.
   The only allowed phrases are now "place an ["element"] element 
   [called "name"] [reading "text"]", "display "text" in the element "name""
   and "display "text" in all "name" elements". The "display "text" in the
   element "name"" phrase affects only the last available element.  
 - Basics: Changed "eval" to "execute JavaScript command/code" and "queue code"
   to "queue JavaScript command/code" 
 - Basics: Moved transient text to the Screen Effects extension
 - Basics: Added phrases to issue commands directly to the parser

   prevented the extension from installing correctly

   window

 - Hyperlinks: Leaving out the links' text content will default to the link
   target.

   the current version
 - Tooltips: Added the missing "Z-machine only" directive 
 - Tooltips: Renamed the say phrase to match the Basics's new phrases

 - Tooltips: Phrases to create tooltips that are activated on mouseover
 - Tooltips: The delay for showing the tooltip can be supplied, and the default
   delay is dropped from 3 seconds to nothing.

   escaping a single quote would crash Parchment.
 - Replaced jPlayer with SoundManager 2
 - Updated jQuery to 1.8.3
 - Updated Noty

   
Modules
-------

 - Changed the source code into a more modular system with actual private
   variables. Functions and variables previously prefixed with underscore
   can't be accessed outside the modules anymore.
 - Core: release and version are now private variables, their values can be
   retrieved with vorple.core.getRelease() and vorple.core.getVersion()
 - Core: Added vorple.core.getEngine() to give the current engine object
 - HTML: Fixed a bug where the second parameter to vorple.html.attributes()
   would have no effect
 - Media: Updated to work with SoundManager instead of jPlayer
 - Media: Added stopSound()
 - Media: Music now fades out when stopped or another song is played, and
   all functions that stop sounds can fade out instead
 - Parser: Character input support

   and ran when the prompt is ready
 - Parser: Meta and dialog commands that have no output will not pop up
   a notification/dialog

 - Parser: Support for commands issued from the story file before 
   play begins
 - Undum: Changed vorple.undum.settings to vorple.undum.defaults


Releases
--------

 - The library is now packaged to three complete minified library files that
   includes everything needed by the system, one for each engine and one
   "vanilla" with no engine. There's also a single JavaScript file that
   contains all third party libraries.
 - Using a single library file also fixes the problem where jQuery was not
   loaded correctly in the Inform 7 interpreter template when there was no 
   Internet connection
 - Added a configurable loader message for Parchment
 - Fixed a rejected command's CSS rule so that it's styled correctly
 - Revised the build script
 - I7 now supports adding custom JavaScript and CSS files, so automatically
   loaded "vorple.custom.js" and "vorple.custom.css" files are now removed 
 - CSS files used by Parchment are now compressed into a single
   "vorple.min.css" file (and concatenated into "vorple.css" for debugging).

   Vorple, not the engine that is otherwise available
 - Core: Removed the clickLink() method, replaced by vorple.undum.doClick() 
   and vorple.undum.doLink()
 - Html: Fixed a bug where vorple.html.url() would not return correct values
   when no filename was given
 - Media: Changed the default YouTube video width from 640 pixels to 600 pixels
   so that the videos fit in the new Parchment version layout
